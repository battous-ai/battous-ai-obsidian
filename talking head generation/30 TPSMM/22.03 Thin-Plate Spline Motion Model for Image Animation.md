# Notes

- Problems of previous works
	- how to learn the __large pose gap__ between the objects in the source and driving images (==? how is it solved in this paper?==)
	- inadequate inpainting network
		- features at different scales
	- estimate the motion using local affine transformation (which is linear)
		- TPS transformation
- Contributions
	- TPS motion estimation
	- end-to-end unsupervised motion transfer framework
		- warps the feature maps using the estimated optical flow
		- leverages multi-resolution occlusion masks
- Why background motion
	- the camera motion in videos will cause the predicted keypoints to appear in the background area?
- Dense Motion Network
	- input
		- K + 1 transformations (?)
			- TPS transformation
			- affine background transformation
	- output
		- optical flow
		- multi-resolution occlusion mask
- Disentangle shape and pose?
	- Shape encoder learns the shape of the keypoints of S?
	- Pose encoder learns the pose of the keypoints of $D_t$?
	- decoder reconstructs the keypoints, perserving the shape of S and the pose of $D_t$?
