- video driven (not audio driven)
- decouple appearance and motion
- from source image
	- appearance (or identity)
		- shape
		- color ?
- from driving image
	- motion
		- pose
- driving video → motion transfer → static object in source image
- motion transfer
	- image warping
		- optical flow
			- from sparse motion-spcific keypoints
		- feature map from source image to the feature domain of the driving image
	- image inpainting 
		- occlusion mask
		- restore the missing regions
- why unsupervised landmark detection
	- priori knowledge of objects, such as 3D models, landmarks, domain labels, which relay on labeled data , only work for specific objects
- how to represent motion
	- transformation
		- local affine transformation
		- thin-plate spline
	- optical flow
