# Architecture

# Notes

- unsupervised learning of a human-perceptible structural representation of images
- landmark discovery as an intermediate step for image autoencoding
	- many soft contraints to enforce a desirable properties for landmarks
		- equivariance: equivariant to image transoformation, including object and camera motions
			- ==thin plate spline (TPS)==
- encoder
	- landmark
		- channel-wise softmax â†’ heatmaps
		- weighted mean inside a single channel
	- local latend descriptor (because landmarks are insufficient to represent all visual content)
		- not too much information to overwhelm the image structures reflected by landmarks
		- low dimensional  local descriptor for each landmark
- controllable image decoding
	- by varying the input landmark (and fixing the latent descriptor), the decoder part can be use to do image manipulation and image generation
