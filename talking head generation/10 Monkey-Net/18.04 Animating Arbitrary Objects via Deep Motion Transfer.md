# Architecture
![[image-20231003081913507.png]]
# Notes

- Image animation framework (to decouple appearance and motion information)
	- Keypoint detector
		 - captures object structure and motion
	- Dense Motion prediction
		- input
			- sparse keypoints
		- output
			- dense heatmaps
	- Motion transfer
		- input
			- motion heatmaps
			- source image (to extract appearance information)
		- output
			- target image
- baseline: X2Face
- formulate the problem of learning a motion representation as an unsupervised motion-specific keypoint detection task
